251,Kelsier burned tin.,3
255,"The tin flared to life within him, burning his stomach like the sensation of a hot drink swallowed too quickly.",3
271,"Burning tin, Kelsier was able to judge the direction accurately.",3
1033,Kelsier smiled; then—burning zinc—he reached out and yanked firmly on the Inquisitor’s emotions.,5
1335,"“This crew already has the eye of the Steel Ministry—do not make an enemy of me as well.”
Milev nodded sharply, then disappeared into the stairwell, pulling the door closed behind him.",2
1796,"“I burn pewter,” Ham said.",4
2187,"The Steel Ministry wants you to believe that he’s immortal, but even he can be killed—by an Allomancer burning this.”
Ham reached out, picking up the thin bar of metal.",2
2375,"They’re certain to have some atium.” He pulled open the pack, then whipped out a dark gray cloak.",17
2408,"He burned steel, second of the basic Allomantic metals.",2
2413,"Burning iron or steel would point blue lines at all kinds of metal, assuming they were close enough and large enough to be noticeable.",1
2415,"Burning steel, he Pushed against the coin.",2
2421,"He burned tin, and felt it flare to life in his chest, enhancing his senses.",3
2426,"Kelsier left his tin on—it burned slowly, and he probably didn’t need to worry about running out.",3
2441,"He often wished that burning tin didn’t enhance all of the senses—or, at least, not all of them at once.",3
2443,"However, burning tin made the night seem even more chilly to his overly sensitive skin, and his feet registered every pebble and wooden ripple they touched.",3
2451,"Kelsier burned iron, flaring it strong and searching the night for large sources of metal.",1
2465,"Kelsier flared his iron, took a deep breath, and Pulled on the line.",1
2467,"Kelsier continued to burn iron, pulling himself toward the keep at a tremendous speed.",1
2477,"Taking a deep breath, Kelsier burned pewter, using it to enhance his physical strength much in the same way that tin enhanced his senses.",3
2487,"Kelsier was upon the man in a second, jumping into the air, Pulling slightly on the guard’s steel breastplate and throwing the man off balance.",2
2509,"Burning pewter to strengthen his body, he reached out and fiercely Steelpushed against both men at the same time.",4
2525,"Kelsier replaced his knives, burning steel and searching for sources of metal.",2
2534,"He simply burned steel, reaching in and tugging against the weak source of metal that he assumed was the trapdoor’s locking mechanism.",2
2535,"It resisted at first, pulling him against the wall, but he burned pewter and yanked harder.",4
2540,"He continued to Pull, holding himself in place, and flared his pewter.",4
2541,"Strength flooded his legs, and he flared his steel as well, Pulling against the safe.",2
2548,"Kelsier fell backward, burning steel and Pushing against the safe to get out of the way.",2
2568,"He flared his pewter, strengthening his body, then squatted down and lifted the safe.",4
2585,"Kelsier flared his pewter, letting strengthened legs carry him back in a powerful jump.",4
2598,"Gritting his teeth, Kelsier flared his pewter again; it was running low, he noticed.",4
2599,Pewter was the fastest-burning of the basic eight metals.,4
2613,"Kelsier flared his steel, Pushing so hard that he tossed himself backward as well—away from the pair of men who tried to attack him.",2
2628,"He downed its contents in a single gulp, replenishing his pewter, then burned tin.",3
2631,"Kelsier whipped his hand to the side, burning iron and searching for metal.",1
2635,Kelsier burned steel with a flash of strength.,2
2640,"He burned iron, Pulling the ingot back toward him.",1
2645,"Kelsier heard the ingot hit the ground behind him, and he reached up—burning pewter—and caught the hazekiller’s cane mid-swing.",4
2650,"Kelsier flared pewter, steadying himself against attacks.",4
2652,"He stumbled to his knees as the wood cracked, but flared tin kept him conscious.",3
2657,"Instead, he burned iron, wrenching the ingot back toward himself.",1
2660,"Kelsier spun, burning iron then steel to send the ingot soaring toward the final two men.",1
2678,"He flared steel, Pushing the coins out of the way.",2
2682,"Thugs—Mistings who, like Ham, could burn pewter.",4
2693,"He smiled, extinguishing his iron and pushing away from the building with his legs, throwing himself out into the mists like some insane diver.",1
2715,"He kept his pewter burning—without the strength it lent his body, he’d probably collapse from the pain of his wounds—and dashed off into the night, heading toward Clubs’s shop.",4
3228,"The Thug grumbled a bit, pulling out a golden ten-boxing coin and flipping it across the room to the self-satisfied Breeze.",4
3431,"He immediately burned iron, and the translucent blue lines shot out from his body, connecting him to nearby sources of metal.",1
3579,“Pewter burns relatively quickly.,4
3582,"With a push of effort, she was able to stoke the flames within her chest, flaring the pewter.",4
3587,"Interesting, she thought, noting how quickly her pewter had burned during that brief moment.",4
3612,For emotions—the external mental powers—you Pull with zinc and Push with brass.,5
3613,You just used pewter to Push your body.,4
3615,"“He burns pewter.”
Kelsier nodded.",4
3616,“Mistings who can burn pewter are called Thugs.,4
3632,“And it’s one of the slowest-burning metals—the tin in that vial is enough to keep you going for hours.,3
3664,"“Let’s try another metal.”
Vin nodded, leaving her tin on but picking another metal to burn as well.",3
3691,"“I started burning copper,” Kelsier said, “the companion to bronze.",7
3692,"When you burn copper, it hides your use of powers from other Allomancers.",7
3698,"However, if you’re ever in a skaa guise and need to burn metals, make sure you turn on your copper first.”
Vin nodded appreciatively.",7
3703,“Anyone burning copper is immune to emotional Allomancy.,7
3709,"Allomantic pulses coming from a shop in a skaa sector of town would be a quick giveaway to a passing Inquisitor.”
“But, you can burn copper,” Vin said.",7
3710,"“Why were you so worried about finding a Smoker for the crew?”
“I can burn copper, true,” Kelsier said.",7
3719,"They started walking again, and Kelsier gave her more time to get used to burning tin.",3
3758,"Take burning pewter, for instance.",4
3766,“Burning tin has consequences too.,3
3768,"“With iron, you can Pull a metal source toward yourself.",1
3769,"With steel, you can Push one away.",2
3775,"“Burn steel, the opposite of the metal you burned a few moments ago.”
Vin nodded.",2
3799,"Knowing how much, or how little, you will move when you burn steel or iron will give you a major advantage over your opponents.",1
3830,"She glanced down at the ingot, burning steel.",2
3886,"She Pushed reflexively with her steel, but her trajectory was off; she had fallen to the side of the ingot, not directly toward it.",2
3888,"Alarmed, she Pushed again—harder this time, flaring her steel.",2
3903,"Eventually, she burned pewter, using the sensation of solidness it provided to steady her nerves.",4
3977,"“Flare your tin,” Kelsier suggested.",3
4157,"Burning tin, she was able to study the neatly organized and well-groomed streets.",3
4403,"She burned pewter with a flash and hit the ground running, dashing along Fellise’s quiet streets.",4
4408,Burning pewter enhanced more than muscles—it increased all the body’s physical abilities.,4
4409,Keeping pewter at a low burn gave her a sense of balance that any night burglar would have envied.,4
4412,"Her copper on to hide her Allomancy, she flared tin to strain her senses.",3
4420,"She flared pewter, landing on the cobbled street beside the wall.",4
4425,"Vin followed, letting go of the coin below her, instead burning iron and Pulling on one of the mansion’s window latches.",1
4459,"Vin flared her steel as she flew, and heard her opponent grunt as he was Pushed backward as well.",2
4461,"Vin slammed into a tree, but she flared pewter and ignored the pain.",4
4843,She started burning copper—as Kelsier had taught her—to shield herself from further manipulations on Breeze’s part.,7
4966,"Just a nudge—a reminder.”
Curious, Vin extinguished her copper for a moment, burning bronze instead, trying to sense Breeze’s use of Allomancy.",7
5079,"While burning atium, a Mistborn was virtually unstoppable, which was part of why it was so valuable.",17
5366,Then she reached inside and burned tin.,3
5384,He itched to burn steel and begin jumping toward his destination.,2
5419,"Kelsier burned tin, and smelled blood on the air.",3
5426,"Taking a breath, he flared pewter and ducked inside.",4
5436,"With a girlish yelp, a small figure ducked to the ground, coins deflected as she burned steel.",2
5791,"The table was too far away to hear unaided, but with tin…
She reached inside to burn the metal, but then paused.",3
5794,"Her Allomancy hidden, she burned tin.",3
5842,"A spark of burned pewter, however, made the climb effortless enough that she didn’t sweat and ruin her makeup.",4
5962,"She got one more glimpse into the main chamber as she retrieved her shawl, and she burned tin, squinting against the light and seeking the balcony above.",3
6001,A quick burn of tin let Vin hear the conversation—Kelsier had finally returned.,3
6068,"She flared iron, and was rewarded with the sight of a fading blue metal line, pointing into the distance.",1
6070,"Vin burned steel, Pushing herself into the cold, humid autumn night.",2
6073,"The maneuver swung her in a soaring arc over the steel gates, which she then Pushed against to throw herself farther into the air.",2
6075,She wasn’t carrying any metal—not even coins—and she kept her copper burning to hide her use of Allomancy.,7
6090,"She flared her iron, but it was barely enough to catch a glimpse of him disappearing again in the distance.",1
6092,"Her flared iron, however, showed her something else.",1
6106,"She Pushed hard, flaring her steel, throwing herself as far up into the sky as she could.",2
6107,"As she flew, she flared her iron, searching for other sources of metal.",1
6124,"She flared tin, and a massive shadow appeared in the night before her, its top sparkling with balls of light.",3
6137,"She wandered randomly, pushing off of window clasps and bits of metal, using the bronze bar—then pulling it back into her hand—when long jumps were necessary.",8
6157,"Her iron showed blue lines moving in the distance, and she hurriedly jumped out over the street and Pushed herself off a sewer grate below, determined not to lose him again.",1
6239,"As he began to walk forward, she drew upon her new well of strength and burned atium.",17
6253,"“While you’re burning atium,” he said, “nothing can surprise you.",17
6260,"“I just burned atium too,” Kelsier said.",17
6264,"“The only way to defeat someone who is burning atium is to burn it yourself—that way, neither of you has an advantage.”
The images vanished.",17
6293,"“I burned up most of my steel getting here.”
Kelsier handed her another vial.",2
6349,"Turn on your copper; that will make you immune.”
Vin nodded, burning copper.",7
6356,"She burned pewter as she fell, and hit the ground with Allomantically strengthened legs.",4
6359,"She ran in the wet, misty night, burning tin and copper—one to let her see, the other to let her hide.",3
6387,She burned steel and threw out a handful of coins.,2
6389,"She burned iron, Pulling the coins back to her hand.",1
6400,"Vin burned tin, her eyes adapting to light from the corridor outside.",3
6413,"Something seemed to Push her emotions, making her more depressed despite her copper.",7
6431,"She flared pewter, willing her legs to move faster.",4
6484,"She clutched Kelsier’s coin pouch and burned iron, frantically seeking an anchor down the corridor.",1
6494,"Vin flared tin and pewter, clearing her mind and pushing away the pain.",3
6530,"She pulled out Kelsier’s vial and downed the atium, then burned it.",17
6566,Flare pewter!,4
6579,"She kept her pewter flared, amazed at how well her body still worked, and stumbled out into the rain, reflexively clutching the leather book to her chest.",4
6599,"She strained in the night, burning tin, the rainfall becoming a thunder in her ears.",3
6603,"She made sure her copper was still burning, Pulled lightly against the spire to hold herself in place, and ripped off a piece of her shirt to bandage the wound.",7
6661,"He still burned pewter, the metal helping him resist his several wounds.",4
6665,Kelsier flared the pewter.,4
6946,Vin was thankful for the pewter burning lightly in her stomach to give strength to her still weak legs.,4
7699,"She quietly turned on her copper, then burned pewter, strengthening her body and washing away a bit of her fatigue.",4
7703,"With pewter burning, her reactions were too fast, her body too strong.",4
7930,"She reached to burn copper and tin, but waited—the disturbance was getting closer.",3
7933,Vin burned tin to hear what was said.,3
7982,"Each metal, when burned, gave off a distinct signal, recognizable to one who was well practiced with bronze.",8
7983,"The man in the distance burned tin, as did the four others Kelsier had sensed hiding around Keep Tekiel.",3
7996,"He paused near the garden well, and—burning bronze to make certain no Allomancers were near—reached into a stand of bushes to retrieve a large sack.",8
7997,It was heavy enough that he had to burn pewter to pull it free and throw it over his shoulder.,4
8492,Vin inched closer—keeping to the side of the boxes—and burned tin.,3
8578,"I can teach you how to use it properly—if you practice what I show you, then you will have an advantage that many Mistborn dismiss.”
“But, don’t other Mistborn know to burn copper?” Vin asked.",7
8586,"“There are great advantages to burning bronze, rather than just running around with your copper on.",7
8588,"Copper makes you immune to having your emotions Pushed or Pulled.”
“But that’s a good thing.”
Marsh cocked his head slightly.",7
8600,"Now burn bronze.”
Vin did so.",8
8625,"“He is burning iron, as I asked him to so that you could practice.",1
8626,"I—of course—am burning bronze.”
“Do they all do that?” Vin asked.",8
8630,"It isn’t intuitive, for instance, that tin Pulls while pewter Pushes.",3
8648,"A long pulse that beats against you and has a quick pattern will be pewter—the internal Pushing physical metal.”
“Why the names?” Vin asked.",4
8651,"With iron, you Pull on something outside of yourself, with steel you Push on something outside of yourself.",1
8652,"With tin you Pull on something inside of yourself, with pewter you Push on something inside of yourself.”
“But, bronze and copper,” Vin said.",3
8662,She lightly began burning copper to mask her Allomancy.,7
8664,"I should be invisible to his senses, she thought, carefully burning both zinc and brass.",5
8704,"You were burning pewter and tin that day—just a tiny bit, barely noticeable.",3
8848,He burned steel and Pushed himself into the air.,2
8852,"Kelsier burned pewter, strengthening his body as he thumped to the deck of the narrowboat leading the caravan.",4
8872,"Kelsier burned tin, wincing slightly at the suddenly blinding sunlight.",3
9140,"Ordinary skaa, even city skaa, didn’t know of things like Steelpushing or Pewter-burning.",4
9187,"He burned zinc, then looked toward Bilg.",5
9188,"While zinc wouldn’t let him read the man’s emotions, it was possible—when burning the metal—to isolate just a single individual for Soothing or Rioting, much as one was able to isolate a single bit of metal from hundreds to Pull on.",5
9269,"Taking a deep breath, Kelsier burned steel and iron.",1
9275,Kelsier flared iron—stabilizing himself by Pulling against a lantern bracket behind—then grabbed the iron studs on Demoux’s vest.,1
9294,"Kelsier grabbed Demoux’s weapon in mid-arc and Pulled against it forcefully, ripping the steel forward with a mighty flare of iron.",1
9300,"Kelsier burned iron, reaching out to grab the weapon and Pull it down, to force the killing blow, but Demoux resisted.",1
9397,"It was distant, but Vin had grown into the habit of burning a little bit of tin at all times.",3
9409,"Vin flared pewter in response, but the item was simply a pink-and-white handkerchief.",4
10092,"Vin flared steel, Pushing herself up a bit higher, then flung another coin into the mists behind her.",2
10314,"Ham could probably show me a few things.”
“You already know how to burn pewter,” Kelsier said.",4
10474,"“All right, you wanted some tips on burning pewter?”
Vin nodded eagerly.",4
10476,“You can watch me fight—burn bronze to see when I’m using Allomancy.,8
10478,"I’ve noticed that young Allomancers tend to always flare their pewter, thinking that the stronger they are, the better.",4
10489,"“Anyway, what I’m trying to explain is that it’s usually best to vary your pewter burning.",4
10582,"He pulled his trunk out from beneath the table, then opened it and poured Vin a small pouch of pewter beads.",4
10602,"“Burn your pewter, Vin.",4
10703,Flared pewter was everything.,4
10753,You’ll recover—you’ll even get better at pushing yourself like this—but right now you just have to keep burning the pewter and stay awake.,4
10805,"He had to flare tin to see anything in the deep darkness, lit only by a bit of reflected sunlight from far above.",3
11138,"Vin squinted, burning tin, and recognized a moderately familiar face.",3
11158,She immediately burned copper.,7
11190,"Then she burned zinc and reached out to help Kelsier, Rioting the emotions of those around her.",5
11197,"“Uncle, you really the burn, right?”
“Yes, my copper is on,” Clubs said testily.",7
11199,"We’re far enough away from the Lord Ruler that it wouldn’t matter anyway—that plaza is enormous.”
Spook nodded, then obviously began burning tin.",3
11284,"Resisting the Lord Ruler’s Pushing on their emotions didn’t seem like half as much a struggle for Kelsier anymore, though Vin had let her zinc lapse.",5
11473,"Today, when he was in the square, I could feel his touch on my emotions even when I was burning copper.”
“That’s not possible, Vin,” Kelsier said with a shake of his head.",7
11524,"“That sounds like a pretty big advantage.”
“True,” Kelsier said, reaching inside of his cloak and pulling out a vial containing several beads of atium.",17
11579,Burning gold is a somewhat….,11
11598,"She looked up at Kelsier, took a breath, and burned gold.",11
12526,She tentatively burned pewter.,4
12978,Her coin pouch contained only bronze clips for Steelpushing.,8
12983,"Vin burned zinc and brass, hitting Kliss with a powerful blast of emotional Allomancy.",5
13040,"With a flare of steel, she threw herself into the air, Pushing against a massive iron door behind her.",1
13041,"She flew forward for a moment, then Pushed powerfully against the rose window’s iron bindings.",1
13061,"Tin flared, illuminating the night.",3
13063,"She burned bronze, using it as Marsh had taught her, searching for signs of Allomancy.",8
13074,"As she ran, she flared pewter and grabbed her dress near the neck, then ripped the garment down the front with a single yank.",4
13085,"Vin cried out, Pushing herself off the bronze roof in an arcing jump.",8
13102,"Vin slid across the rooftop, then Pulled herself to a brief halt, spinning with one hand resting against the cold bronze.",8
13116,"He, of course, Pushed back—but Vin anchored herself against the bronze roof and flared Steel, Pushing with a firm effort.",2
13127,"With another flare of pewter, Vin slammed her shoulder into the man’s chest, shoving him to the side.",4
13149,"She burned iron, searching frantically for an anchor in the night.",1
13187,"She burned steel, Pushing it out into the air in front of her.",2
13188,"Then, she immediately burned iron and yanked on the bead of atium.",1
13199,She burned atium.,17
13207,"She has plenty of atium, Vin thought, feeling her own storage burn away.",17
13214,She’s just waiting for my atium to burn out.,17
13220,"Her own blood flew in the air as she spun—each droplet tossing out a translucent atium image—and flared pewter, punching Shan square in the stomach.",4
13228,"At that moment, Vin burned her last bit of atium.",17
13300,She bore it without much visible discomfort—though she obviously had her pewter flared.,4
13478,"“Kelsier,” she said slowly, “I think that Inquisitors can sense our Allomancy even when we’re burning copper.”
“Impossible.”
“I did it tonight.",7
13482,"“I can feel the Lord Ruler’s touch on my emotions, even when I’m burning copper.",7
13492,"She was the Allomancer, burning tin, that led them to you.”
Kelsier’s face took on a troubled expression.",3
13495,"Tell me what metal I’m burning.”
Vin closed her eyes, flaring bronze, listening…feeling, as Marsh had taught her.",8
13509,"You’re burning pewter.”
Kelsier blinked in surprise.",4
13840,“Tin burning…Notting about the seeing.,3
13845,"Iffing the power of wants, ignoring the distractions of both.”
If you want to be good at burning tin, she thought, translating as best she could, learn to deal with distraction.",3
13979,"She flared pewter and tin immediately, falling to a crouch, listening for attackers.",3
14039,"“Tell Renoux to pull out,” Kelsier said softly, his voice like iron.",1
14141,Then he burned tin.,3
14151,"He burned iron, and immediately he saw several blue lines pointing downward, toward atium-holes.",1
14255,“The crystals are why the Lord Ruler can’t just send down Allomancers to Pull out the atium geodes.,17
14328,"“Vin, you hear that?”
She closed her eyes, then flared her tin.",3
14411,"He flared steel with a yell, standing and Pushing outward.",2
14446,"“I won the draw.”
Kelsier flared pewter, dashing to the side as the Inquisitor pulled out a pair of obsidian axes.",4
14458,"As he landed, he reached out—Pulling against one of the carts to anchor himself—and Pulled against the fallen iron door he had thrown before.",1
14532,"Fists clinched, he flared his steel in a massive Push.",2
14546,"He burned atium, as did the Inquisitor—and they both probably had enough to last for an extended fight.",17
14556,"Kelsier flared iron, Pulling against a patch of soldiers to his right while still Pulling against the single soldier.",1
14576,"Kelsier Pushed out with a yell, flaring pewter to keep from crushing himself.",4
14593,"Kelsier flared pewter, then crashed into the soldier he had Pulled up toward him.",4
14611,"Kelsier grabbed the bars, flaring both steel and iron, Pushing against one tip of each bar and Pulling against the opposite tip.",1
14629,"There was a reason Pewterarms were also called Thugs: there was no subtlety to their fighting, no clever Ironpulls or Steelpushes.",4
14653,"Kelsier flared steel within, stoking it, raging it until his chest burned like the Ashmounts themselves.",2
14707,"“Renoux is down!” Vin said, squinting and burning tin.",3
14719,"“He’s still fighting the Inquisitor.”
Kelsier flared his pewter, punching the Inquisitor, careful to avoid the flat disks of metal sticking out the front of its eyes.",4
14731,"Kelsier reached out, grabbing smaller metal sources and Pulling them away from their owners—metal caps, fine steel swords, coin pouches, daggers.",2
14732,He threw them at the Inquisitor—carefully manipulating Steelpushes and Ironpulls—and kept his atium burning so that each item he controlled would have a fanning multitude of atium-images in the Inquisitor’s eyes.,17
14802,"She flared her copper, but—as always—she could still slightly feel the Lord Ruler’s oppressive hand.",7
14818,"The Lord Ruler stepped from his carriage, and Vin leaned forward, burning tin.",3
14959,"“Mistress, is that you up there?”
Vin sighed, burning tin, then extinguishing steel and letting herself drop.",2
15103,"Vin walked up to it, then flared pewter and smashed off the lock.",4
15253,"She turned, pulling out a vial of metal and drinking its contents, using the liquid to wash down a couple beads of atium.",17
15315,"Vin burned atium, then whipped her hands from beneath her cloak, tossing a double handful of arrowheads into the air.",17
15316,"She flared steel, Pushing powerfully against the rings of metal wrapped loosely around the arrowheads’ broken hafts.",2
15510,"She opened dizzy eyes—blinking away the water that had been thrown on her—and immediately burned pewter and tin, bringing herself completely awake.",3
15537,"Still, she didn’t have copper to burn—she had no way to hide from the Lord Ruler’s powerful, almost omnipotent, hand.",7
15553,"Instinctively, she tried to burn iron, expecting the blue lines to appear—but, of course, she had no iron to burn.",1
15556,She couldn’t burn tin to listen for voices.,3
15557,She couldn’t burn pewter to strengthen her against the pain of her hurting arm and head.,4
15558,She couldn’t burn bronze to search for nearby Allomancers.,8
15584,The moment when I burned the Eleventh Metal felt like that time when Kelsier had me burn gold.,11
15588,"Iron Pulled, steel Pushed.",1
15589,"Zinc Pulled, brass Pushed.",5
16137,"She burned copper, pushing aside the Lord Ruler’s Soothing.",7
16245,"Vin cried out in pain, flaring her pewter, pushing back, but Kar forced her to her feet.",4
16305,"A small group of steel spikes, just like the one Marsh had pulled from Kar’s back, lay piled on the floor.",2
16310,"The depression, the anger-fueled asphyxiation of her soul, pushed through her copper, hitting her like a physical force.",7
16311,"She flared copper, gasping slightly, but wasn’t completely able to push the Lord Ruler off of her emotions.",7
16331,But he had also said that no Allomancer could affect the emotions of a person who was burning copper.,7
16348,"Am I some common Inquisitor, my powers endowed fabrications?”
Vin flared pewter.",4
16351,"Even within a full pewter flare, Vin couldn’t outrun him.",4
16387,"She flared pewter, but tears came to her eyes anyway.",4
16456,"Yet, she burned iron.",1
16461,She flared the iron.,1
16463,"Vin stoked her iron, concentrating, Pushing it as hard as she could.",1
16464,"She kept her pewter flared, struggling to keep from being crushed, and she knew somehow that she was no longer breathing.",4
16476,"She flared her iron higher and higher, the Lord Ruler’s own Push giving her the leverage she needed to Pull against his bracelets.",1
16487,"However, with her last bit of strength—pewter gone—Vin Pushed on the bracelets, shooting them past the Lord Ruler.",4
16507,"She reflexively flared pewter, strengthening her body.",4
16508,"She flared tin, and the sudden increase of sensitivity shocked her awake.",3
